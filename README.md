## Project Description 

In this game, the player is a anaconda who's goal is to eat as many mice that appear on the screen as they can. Each mouse will make the snake grow longer and counts as 1 point, and the player will win once they hit 100 points. If the player runs into its own body, it's game over and they must restart. The snake is controlled by the arrows on the players keyboard or the arrows on the screen (⬆️➡️⬇️⬅️), moving in the direction of the keystroke or click.

### Stretch Goals

#### Adding simple, pleasant sound effects such as:
- A chomp when the snake eats a mouse
- An upbeat and pleasant tone when hitting the start button
- A somewhat sad tone when you lose
- A mild crashing sound when hitting a wall, and alternatively a slightly different crashing sound when the head hits the body
- Gameplay music

#### Along with the sound effects, adding a mute button for our silent gamers
